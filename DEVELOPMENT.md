# Local development

## Prerequisites

- Node.js with npm
- MariaDB 10.11
- The existing `cfaccounting` database initialized from `db/schema.sql`

## Install and configure

```bash
npm install
cp api/.env.example api/.env
```

Edit `api/.env` with the local or server database credentials and a strong,
random `JWT_SECRET`.

Before applying pending migrations, create and verify a recoverable database
backup. Then run:

```bash
ACCOUNTING_MIGRATION_BACKUP_CONFIRMED=1 npm run schema:migrate
npm run schema:verify
```

Migration `0002` expects the new accounting tables to contain no real ledger
data because it establishes required user ownership. If ledger data is added
before this migration, assign it to a person in a dedicated backfill migration
instead of forcing `owner_person_id` to `NOT NULL` directly.

## Run

In separate terminals:

```bash
npm run dev:api
npm run dev:client
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`. Registration creates the person's accounting
profile and five root accounts in the selected functional currency.

## Verification

```bash
npm test
npm run build
npm run schema:verify
```

The API also exposes `POST /api/ledger/verify` for an authenticated user. It
reruns the same central accounting invariants used when posting transactions.
